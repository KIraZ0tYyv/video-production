## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Informational videos

*Informational videos* are different from *screenplay*:

- entertain, but also solve problems
- specify shots and the use of graphics
- presented by a narrator (on camera, voice-over, or both)
- most common formats: two columns (visual and audio) or modified screenplay (includes a column on the right for voice-over narration)

Main considerations:

- informational videos have goals
- write for the ear, not the eye
- observe grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules, but be conversational (balance proper English with conversational word choices)
- proofread (read backwards, bottom to top, and out loud)


### 1.2. Goals and purposes

Informational videos have goals, the ideal video should probably have a single goal, but that's often not possible. In addition to goals, videos have purposes: *motivate*, *train*, or *inform*. Most informational videos will use a combination of these purposes (e.g. to persuade a viewer to do something you need to provide a context; to train someone to do something you need to persuade them why it's valuable).

- **Motivate** (persuade viewer)
    - change or adopt behaviour
    - support a cause (with time or money)
    - buy a product or a service

- **Train** (how to do something)
    - step-by-step instruction
    - overall guidance

- **Inform** (educate viewer)
    - often incorporated with the other purposes
    - provide context or history


### 1.3. Modes of persuasion

There are three common modes of persuasion that writers use, and most informational videos will need a little of each one:

1. **Logos**
    - logical approach
    - uses facts, evidence, and reason to make arguments

2. **Ethos**
    - ethical approach
    - relies on image, trust, reputation, honesty
    - often uses celebrity endorsement (assuming the celebrity is ethical)

3. **Pathos**
    - emotional approach
    - appeals to passion, feelings, and raw emotions
    - used most in advertising


### 1.4. Script terminology

Shorthand language enables quick communication, here are some common terminology used in script writing:

- every page of a script should have a *header*
- **two column script** (video on the left, audio on the right)
- **slug** is the description of a scene
- **action paragraph** describes the action that's going on in front of the camera
- **character name** is the name of the person who's speaking in this scene, followed by the dialogue that they are saying (could also be on-camera narrator)
- **parenthetical** is the writer's advice to the actor on how to deliver the line (actors generally don't like this)
- it's better not to give suggestions to the editor too (e.g., suggest the genre/feel/tempo of the music in the scene rather than a concrete song); don't suggest special visual effects and transitions either (that's editor's work)


### 1.5. Shot types and camera moves

There are three basic *shot types* (plus some variations):

- **Long Shot (LS)** (full body shot)
- **Medium Shot (MS)** (waist up)
- **Close Up (CU)** (head and shoulders)
+
- **Extreme Long Shot (ELS or XLS)** (bigger than LS)
- **Medium Long Shot (MLS)** (between LS and MS)
- **Medium Close Up (MCU)**
- **Extreme Close Up (ECU or XCU)**

Common *camera moves* (typically don't want to indicate them in a script):

- **Pan** (camera head moves horizontally)
- **Tilt** (camera head moves vertically)
- **Zoom** (zoom in/out)
- **Boom (dolly shot**, or **truck shot)** (camera and tripod physically moves from one place to another)
- **Handheld**


### 1.6. Media sources

- *video sources*:
    - original video
    - b-roll (supplemental or alternative footage intercut with the main shot)
    - archive video
    - graphics
    - animation
- *talent sources*:
    - **VO (voice over)** (viewer doesn't see the narrator)
    - **VOC (voice on camera)** (viewer sees the narrator)
    - **SOT (sound on tape)** (soundbite from an interview subject)
    - **dialogue** (performed by actors)
- *audio sources*:
    - **talent**
    - **NATS (natural sound)** (recorded with the video)
    - **SFX (sound effects)**
    - **music** (prerecorded)
- *graphics sources*:
    - full screen text
    - animation (e.g., the lower third key)
    - bug (logo in the corner)

## 2. Script writing

### 2.1. Informational script types

#### Two column script

- one that most people are familiar with
- the video is on one side, the audio is on the other side

#### Video script

- starts as the *screenplay format*, but there is also a voice over column
- we see it first on the page, and then we hear it on the page

### 2.2. Analyzing the audience

The scriptwriting process begins with asking questions about your audience. And the answers will help to tailor the language of the script.

- what's the budget?
- who's the audience? (size, demographics, psychographics, etc.; there is no such thing as general audience)
- what's the goal of the project? (motivate/train/inform)
- what's the main topic? (no more than 3 per video or it gets too long and complex)
- how and where the video will be seen? (one on one or live audience, youtube video, on the company website, in the business meeting, at the training session, etc.)


### 2.3. Determining the look

Video script writing process also involves asking questions about the video structure and its desired outcome.

- what's the structure? (narrow or broad scope, how long, is it a series of videos, etc.)
- what's the format?
    - narrative (fictional)
    - newscast (styled as news broadcast)
    - documentary (VO, VOC, interviews, re-enactments, etc.)
- determine the amount of humour


### 2.4. Organizational questions

- all shooting first or all writing first?
    - do pre-interviews (audio only)?
    - shoot discovery interviews?
- is there a budget for a professional narrator and actors?
- who needs to approve the script?


### 2.5. Outline

An **outline** is a great way to start with general information before getting into the specifics of the video. Outline helps to make sure that everyone's on the same page. It's also easier to change the direction of the video at the outline stage of the production.

- no narration and no dialogue (paraphrase dialogue exchange instead)
- describe what's happening, but don't specify shots (unless it's really important)
- concentrate on the content rather than the visual aspect of it
- indicate change in music, but don't specify the details
- common three act story structure (journalistic approach):
    
    > Tell them what you're going to tell them. Tell them. And tell them what you told them.

At the presentation to the client expect changes, rewriting an outline a couple times is a common practice. After the outline gets approval you are ready to start writing the first draft of a script. But remember: the first draft of any writing is unfit for human consumption, good writing evolves from rewriting.


### 2.6. Presenting the script

Tips for presenting a script to the client:

- can read aloud the script the first time the client sees it (since most people don't know how to understand a script), so they would focus on a spoken word instead of a printed word
- describe what's going on, not just read the text
- after presenting the script, expect changes and embrace suggestions


### 2.7. Scripts for commercial videos

Basic commercial genres:

- price and item
- testimonials (real or simulated user of the product or service)
- VO and VOC
- product comparisons
- narrative driven mini movies (beware of humor)

Guidelines:

- use adjectives sparingly (nothing is that great)
- concise sentence structure (easier to understand and because of time limitations)
- use action verbs (avoid passive language; don't use the verb *"is"*)
- call to action
- when writing a script for a PSA (*public service announcement*) use the same techniques as for commercial videos


### 2.8. Finalizing the script

Everything improves with editing (*"writing is rewriting"*).

- read a script out loud (or have someone else read it for you)
- storyboarding (if required)
- make a list of all the actors, narrators, extras, props, costumes, and other things that will be needed during the production
- after everything is approved, prepare for production (locations, sets, video gear, additional equipment, etc.)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Marking up a script

It's useful to mark up a script with visual reminders how to read various lines. There are standards, but markings can be specific to the actor.

Common markings and terminology:

- **sides** (a shortened version of the script with just the lines a particular actor is supposed to read; but can simply highlight lines for a specific character in a regular script)
- **double (or triple) spaced script** (gives more room for notes)
- **comma and slash** (to see commas better when reading a script) 
- **circles** (to mark words with unclear pronunciation; can check them, e.g. at www.forvo.com)
- **up and down arrow** (cue to raise or lower a voice/tone/pace)
- **all caps** (raise a voice; or yell)
- **bold or underline** (to emphasize particular words)
- different letters: **H** (happy), **E** (excited), **C** (calm), and other

### 1.2. Character and production info

The more a voice actor knows about their character and the entire project, the better. This info could be:

- the idea behind the project and the big picture, character designs, complete descriptions, or even the storyboards
- character motivation, what happened in a previous scenes, etc.
- character inspirations from other fiction works
- *for producers*: avoid line reading to actors; *for actors*: ask producers questions


### 1.3. Industry standards

There are certain standards that everyone expects in a voice recording session.

- all phones in airplane mode
- *producer*
    - should overlap the schedule (some voices tend to go longer, some tend to go shorter)
    - should be prepared with organization
    - can ask a voice actor to do more than one voice in a session
- *actors*
    - should be prepared to wait (if the session before is taking longer than expected; or during the session itself)
    - should not change the script (but suggestions are okay)
    - should be patient and professional, they can be asked to read the same line a dozen times
    - do nots:
        - don't touch the mic and don't change its position
        - don't make noise with script sheets
        - don't wear noisy clothing (no bracelets or long earrings)
        - don't apologize for bad takes

## 2. Producing voice-over

### 2.1. Preparing for a session

Tips for *producers*:

- deliver sides, character images, and character description to actors (to help them get into the role)
- note in the script whatever other sounds and noises are needed from the actors
- prior to a session, remind actors of their upcoming session and call times
- assistant might be very helpful
- get to the studio early and make sure everything's prepped properly
- bring extra copies of the script just in case
- if there are *executives* on a set, only the producer should interact with them (not to mess up the working process)


### 2.2. Finding VO talent

There are many options for finding voice-over actors:

- web sites with voice actors for hire (plus often actors have their own sites), e.g. www.voices.com, www.voice123.com, www.voicebunny.com, www.thevoicerealm.com, www.voiver.com and www.productionhub.com
- delegate responsibilities to *talent agencies* or *casting agents*
- ask other actors for suggestions
- local improv comedy shows


### 2.3. Hiring VO talent

The right you pay for each voice actor will depend on:

- the type of a project
- experience of an actor
- how many people are likely to see the project
- how many characters actor needs to perform
- is this a lead or side character
- how many lines there are for each character
- how many hours a session is expected to last
- if it's commercial, how big is the advertiser, how long it's going to air, etc.


### 2.4. Table read

The **table read** is an informal reading of a script. The goal is to make sure the script is as strong as possible. Tip: the producer (or director) should not be one of the voices, they should listen and make notes.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data/table read.jpg" width="500" title="table read"></p>

- if someone stumbles with a line during the readings, maybe it needs to be edited
- sometimes actors can come up with great extra material
- producer can get some new ideas during read-through
- at the end of the reading actors can share their thoughts and give some suggestions


### 2.5. Long-distance voice recording

Today many professional voice-actors have small recording studios at home. So producers can direct them over the phone or internet.

Video call are preferable to only audio calls:

- director can help more with acting and suggestions
- it's also easier for actors because they can see the feedback
- it can also be helpful to be on the line with the engineer (if it's not a home studio)


### 2.6. Notes for voice talent

Even the best actors can sometimes fall into traps of reading a line the same way over and over. Few tips and tricks to get actors to vary their line readings.

- only the director (or producer) should ever give notes to the actors directly (others, e.g. clients or executives, only through the director)
- producer should start a session by explaining to the actor who their character is, what they feel, and what's happening to them
- director can watch their actors, it's easier to direct them this way, e.g. ask them to smile, physically act out something, stand or sit, emphasize specific words, can also suggest a famous character to emulate
- when recording a recurring voice that actor has done before, ask audio engineer to play back a previous recording for reference
- **don't give line reading to actors** (unless actor asks for them, or they are amateurs)
- if an actor is having a hard time with a specific line, move on and return to it later
- director could push actors for big emotions and expressions, should not be afraid to tell them exactly what is needed


### 2.7. Recording multiple actors

For general dialogue scenes, it's faster and easier to record one voice at a time (singular voices are easy to edit). But sometimes it's a good idea to record multiple actors at the same time, this can give awesome character interactions.

- humor is all about timing, and good comic actors can feed off of one another and give a script the perfect timing
- emotions can be hard to realistically portray in a sterile environment
- multiple actors recording at once will often give overlapping dialogues, so they can't be edited that much


### 2.8. Keep takes

During a session, director need to be able to keep track of all the *keep takes*. When the take is good, assistant and/or sound engineer should mark it.

- sound engineer will usually save and deliver just the keep takes (but director could tell them to save everything)
- can mark keep takes on the script, but can also write a separate list for this purpose
- there could be multiple good takes that director would want to save

### 2.9. Organizing audio files

Proper naming of files can save a huge amount of time in the edit suite.

- when a script is ready for recording, number the lines of dialogue, so during the recording audio files are named according to the dialogue line numbers
- after a dialogue line number, you can add the character name and a word or two from the line
- for extra sounds between dialogue lines, number those additionally with letters, e.g. `22A` and `22B`

## 3. Professional voice-over

### 3.1. Voice artists

Tips for voice artists (business):

- get training (acting classes, voice acting classes) and practice (improv in comedy shows, live acting, VO sessions)
- continuously update your demo reel and your website (and only include your best work there)
- to get started, offer your services to friends or local businesses (to help build a resume)
- submit yourself to voice actor websites
- join or participate in local advertising groups and associations (to make connections)

Tips for voice artists (work):

- never change the script (but suggestions are okay)
- watch your plosives (P's and T's)
- don't touch the mic and don't change its position
- don't breathe directly into the mic
- protect your voice (no parties and yelling the night before a session)
- drink warm liquids (not cold ones)
- write down tips how to get into the character (to use them later if needed)


### 3.2. Preparing for a session

The better prepared you are for a voiceover session the more likely you are to be asked to work again.

- ask for the sides and other information about your character
- read the entire script (not only your lines)
- don't damage your voice the night before a session
- warm up your voice and drink warm fluids
- be prepared to wait

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="data/studio.jpg" width="500" title="studio"></p>


### 3.3. Work with a director

- if you struggle with a particular line, suggest to move on and rerecord it later (or ask for line reading in worst case scenario)
- if you're getting the same note from the director, try going in different direction
- feel free to experiment and really push your voice (unless everyone's happy with a current voice)
- give a director three slight variation with every take, they will give feedback, and then you will try again
- things a director might ask for:
    - to be quicker, pick up the pace (or to be slower and don't rush it)
    - change timing in general
    - add energy
    - emphasize specific words
    - to be more angry or tense


### 3.4. Tricks for better line readings

It's important to sound natural, some tips to achive it:

- make it sound like you're talking to a friend (e.g. maybe talk to someone on the other side of the soundproof glass)
- read through the script aloud a number of times before a session
- practice reading from the teleprompter (there are many mobile apps)
- if you find a word or a line difficult, you can always suggest a word change
- record yourself and listen back to it (gives a new perspective)

Ways to vary a line reading:

- physical:
    - physically act out emotions (e.g. jump around)
    - face gestures
    - stretch out or compress your neck
    - sitting vs standing
- warm drinks smooth the vocal cords (to remove raspiness), cold drinks tighten the vocal cords
- emulate famous character
- don't afraid to speak loudly
- think of something emotional and let that affect your read


### 3.5. Voice demos and website

The best voice demos have a number of varied voices all presented in very short segments. Just a few seconds of each voice is enough for a producer or director to know if they like it.

- in demos move on quickly (so people don't get bored)
- in the beginning of your demo reel, state your name
- can add video demos too
- mention if you can record in your own studio or not (long distance work)
- make it easy to contact you

## 4. Voice-over for personal projects

### 4.1. Personal voice recordings

You're always judged by every aspect of production.

- invest in decent sound quality
- know the basics of editing and enhancing audio
- treat yourself in a recording session the same way you would a voice actor, i.e. push yourself and record multiple takes
- can use teleprompter
- same advice as for professional voice over: physically act out emotions, speak loudly, don't be shy, etc.


### 4.2. Sound quality

There are a few tricks to getting better sound for your own personal projects.

- try to create quite environment (cover doors and walls with sound-baffling materials, e.g. foam panels or just a soft fabric hanging over a door or a wall)
- can use small vocal reflection baffle
- invest in a desent mic (prefer cardioid mics) and other audio equipment (shock mount for a mic, pop-filter, headphones, etc.)
- can also use lavalier mics
- turn off anything near you that could make noises (e.g. not used computers)
- can try to remove background noise with audio restoration software (e.g. Ozone RX)

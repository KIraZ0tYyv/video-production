There are different genres of video, yet they require many of the same steps to produce good consistent results.

1. **Pre-production**: planning project and writing a story (most important part).
2. **Production**: capturing footage.
3. **Post-production**: craft footage into a compelling story using video editing software.

## 1. Genres of videos

Compared to other art forms, moving images are a very recent development, but the idea of a story is as old as language itself.

- **Narrative** filmmaking seeks to tell a fictional story or a dramatized version of historical events.
- **Documentary** filmmaking tells stories rooted in reality, exploring people, places, events, and ideas throughout history and present day.
- **Corporate** video involves messages used for communication by companies and organizations. These can range from workplace safety and human resources videos to sales, promotional, and branding campaigns used to position products and build relationships with a customer base.
- **Commercials** are designed to sell products and services to a wide audience through broadcast television or a targeted audience through the internet.


## 2. Pre-production

Trying to get shots without a clear creative goal is a great way to waste time and money. That's why the most important step in the video production process is *pre-production*.

1. A well-ordered system starts with a clearly defined **goal**, so every video production needs to start with an idea that can be clearly communicated with words. Writing down your ideas forces you to think them through from beginning to end in a way that cannot be done behind the camera.

    > If you can't explain your idea in a complete sentence, then it cannot be done.

    Once the goal is written down, it becomes the driving force in the creation of the project and context in which you can begin to write an *outline*.

2. Just like in a book, the **outline** covers the major points of your project. The outline is a listing of the important creative elements of your project and a document you share with a producer.

    A producer is a critical component of the production. Their job is to organize all of the parts of a project into a manageable and executable sequence of events. Producers take on all of the organization and planning of a shoot, which frees the director to focus purely on the creative goal of the project.

    The director and producer work closely together to answer every possible question about the project, i.e., how many crew members, what does the set look like, do we need to hire extras, etc.

3. The outline is just the beginning of the writing process. A producer can do a lot with a simple goal and an outline but the real work on a project begins when the **scripts** are written.

    The script-writing process is where your ideas come to life. Even if you're creating a music video with no spoken words, the act of writing out your story in detail causes your mind to think through every shot of the piece.


## 3. Shooting

If you understand that you're not stuck with the image you can see through your camera's viewfinder, that you can move objects in the frame, that you can light to create and control emotion, and that audio is at least as important as the picture, then you'll make a huge step in your development as a shooter.

- Capturing beautiful **video** images relies on a lot of the same concepts as photography. It also requires knowing a lot about technicalities of this process, e.g., understanding exposure triangle of shutter speed or angle, F-stop, ISO, controls on a camera.
- Many people starting out with shooting video often use the **light** that's around them, called available light, to capture images. But when the light changes or is not in the right place, it can become a production nightmare. So learning how to control and manipulate light will take your shots to the next level and beyond. 
- Light, composition, and movement are not the only areas to think about. Getting good **sound** is the most important thing. Using microphones to capture great audio adds a lot of production value to your project.


## 4. Editing

Every film has three stories: the story you write and conceive, the story you shoot in camera, and the story you edit. Each part of the video production process has a huge impact on the final product. But editing is where the project actually comes together.

- In video editing, you take all of the elements of your project, the picture, the sound, graphics, still images, and assemble them into a coherent message to your viewer. Editor creates and controls the timing, pacing, structure, and transitions of the piece. It's through editing that the audience's heartbeat and breath can be elevated or softened.
- Editors don't just craft the story, they also have to do very technical tasks like fixing shaky camera movement, or correcting for mistakes in exposure, or blurring out the license plate on a car passing through a shot.
- The primary tool of video editing is the NLE (non-linear editor). Non-linear editing is a term that distinguishes computer-based systems from the old days of linear editing, where a film or video image had to be laid down in sequence from beginning to end, with no ability to take a clip and split it apart.
- In addition to the NLE, video editors often have to use other tools like Photoshop for manipulating photos and still graphics, or After Effects for creating motion graphics that can be rendered out as clips and incorporated into an editing project.


## 5. Color correction, graphics and sound

The process of editing allows you to craft a compelling and coherent story, and it's the most important part of post-production. But your project really isn't finished until you've spent time *color correcting* your footage, adding *graphics* and *overlays*, and *music* and *sound effects*.

1. **Color correction**
    - In high end productions like a feature film or commercial, the images that a cinematographer captures are shot with the idea that they will be heavily color corrected in post (*shooting flat*). A flat video image is one who's black levels have been lifted up, and white levels have been lowered. This preserves information in the darkest and lightest parts of the image so that a colorist can make the most of the image in post.
    - You can also add more color by raising the saturation. You can even shift the color in a new direction to add a layer of emotion to a scene.
    - Even if you're working with video that was shot normally, you're still going to encounter problems and inconsistencies with the images. Over-exposed, under-exposed, incorrect color balance. These are the kinds of issues that can be fixed with color correction.

2. **Graphics and effects**
    - Depending on the type of project you're working on, these graphics could be a lower third calling out important people or places or full screen graphics that detail crucial concepts or support ideas and arguments.
    - These graphics could be still or motion graphics that have full animation. The most important part of the graphics process, though, is that they match the style of your message.
    - There are tools for adding graphics built in to every video editing package, but at the professional level, it's common to see applications like Adobe Photoshop and After Effects.

3. **Audio**
    - Audio is the most important part of the production. People will forgive poor video quality as long as they can hear what's going on. The process for creating good audio for a video project starts when you're shooting, but the audio post-production process can make or break the audio that you start with.
    - Audio editing is usually very rough until this last phase of post-production. You'll start by cleaning up your dialogue and voiceover editing, listening for pops and dead spots or big shifts in intensity or volume. Then you can fix noisy audio using filters in your editing application.
    - Video NLEs have a host of audio tools built in, but sometimes you'll need the power of a dedicated audio editor, like Adobe's Audition or Avid's Pro Tools.
